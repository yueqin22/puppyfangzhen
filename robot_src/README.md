OOMWOO is an *open-source home robot vacuum* you can build yourself, built using
Raspberry Pi, 3D-printing, Home Assistant, Arduino and ROS2. It uses an
affordable 2D LiDAR to map your home and navigate on its own. Local, no
cloud required for regular functionality, no vendor lock-in. Follow us building in public

## Contributing

Would you like to contribute? See [CONTRIBUTING](docs/CONTRIBUTING.md) for the full guide.

OOMWOO is organized to built by the community, massively *in parallel*.
The vacuum and its software are subdivided into [modules](#requests-for-contributions), see list below.

A volunteer picks whatever module she wants and works on it whenever she wants.
For *code and simulation* modules she builds her package in her *own repo* and sends
a short PR *linking* it from the module; for *docs and specs* she contributes files
in-tree under `contributions/module-name/<her-github-username>`. See
[CONTRIBUTING](docs/CONTRIBUTING.md) for how this works.

Multiple developers are welcome to work on the same module.
The best solution for each module surfaces over time, with the project master having the last call.

1. Pick a contribution from the [list below](#requests-for-contributions).
2. [Let us know](https://github.com/makerspet/oomwoo/discussions) you're working on it and your progress.
3. Check [ARCHITECTURE.md](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md) and
   [SOFTWARE_INTERFACES.md](docs/SOFTWARE_INTERFACES.md) for the system design
   and ROS2 interfaces.

## Requests for Contributions

Every module below is *actionable now* — build it against the Gazebo simulation
([oomwoo-one](https://github.com/makerspet/oomwoo-one)) or a real *placeholder robot*
(a [Proscenic M6 Pro connected to ROS2](https://makerspet.com/blog/tutorial-connect-robot-vacuum-cleaner-to-ros-2-proscenic-m6-pro/)),
until OOMWOO hardware is ready. Pick one, tell us in
[Discussions](https://github.com/makerspet/oomwoo/discussions), build it in your own
repo (docs and specs go in-tree), and send a short PR linking it from the module.

## User requirements &amp; Design research

Anecdotal prospective user requirements - collected mostly in [r/RobotVacuums](https://www.reddit.com/r/RobotVacuums/), [r/ROS](https://www.reddit.com/r/ROS/) and as [announcement post](https://makerspet.com/blog/building-an-open-source-robot-vacuum-meet-oomwoo/) comments:

- open-source
- 3D printed first
- cleans well, a first-class appliance, not a throwaway build
  - never gets stuck
  - hair tangle-free
  - modern capabilities - no legacy drag mop; dual-spinning rotary mop or better/roller
  - bagless
- hackable, DIY fixable, upgrade-able
  - examples: vacuum-only version, mop-only version
  - Raspberry Pi
  - Home Assistant integration
- operates without cloud
- later: ability to retrofit existing legacy vacuum cleaner robots

## About

The project name "OOMWOO" is a rotational ambigram - it reads the same flipped 180°, like the robot itself, roaming your floor in every direction.

The project is sponsored by makerspet.com and remake.ai. We are reusing their open-source solutions.
- If you'd rather skip the parts hunt, a kit (motors, PCB, brushes, gaskets, LiDAR) will be available at [makerspet.com](https://makerspet.com), from the same maker behind this project. The kit is a convenience, never a requirement. *Everything here stays open.*
- When we get to apps, [remake.ai](https://remake.ai) will be providing its robot apps platform and app store. Using the app store will be entirely optional. The vacuum will *always support cloud-free, local operation for regular functionality out-of-the-box*.
