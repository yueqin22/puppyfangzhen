# Floor-Surface Handling & Edge Cleaning (ROS2 package)

Clean *better* by adapting to the floor. This package adds *wall following* (to
clean tight against walls), *carpet-edge following*, recognizing *carpet vs
hardwood*, and *lifting / lowering the mop* accordingly (never wet a carpet).
Because the physical robot isn't built yet, this is a *Gazebo simulation* — you
model the surfaces and the surface sensor in Gazebo; it is later re-validated on
hardware in the [live-robot-bringup RFC](../live-robot-bringup).

> *Status — ready to start work.* No need to wait for OOMWOO hardware — develop it in the
> Gazebo sim ([urdf-gazebo-sim](../urdf-gazebo-sim)) or on the real
> [placeholder Proscenic M6 Pro](https://makerspet.com/blog/tutorial-connect-robot-vacuum-cleaner-to-ros-2-proscenic-m6-pro/).
> Say so in the [discussions](https://github.com/makerspet/oomwoo/discussions) so we can coordinate.

# Prior art — wall/edge-following approaches

Wall following spans a spectrum from *no dedicated sensors* to *dedicated wall
sensors* — pick what fits the hardware you model. Simplest to richest:

- *Reactive bump-follow (no sensors).* The pre-sensor classic: cruise on a gentle
  arc into the wall, and on a bumper contact back off and turn away — peeling
  along the wall and rounding corners. A working reference already lives in
  [oomwoo_clean](https://github.com/makerspet/oomwoo-ros2-tools) (`wall_clean`
  node + `wall_clean.launch.py`: bumpers → `/cmd_vel`, live/`kaia`-tunable). Cheap
  and honest, but it leaves a sawtooth gap — *randomize the turn amount* so it
  can't limit-cycle
  ([Brown CS148](https://cs.brown.edu/courses/cs148/documents/asgn1_enclosure/bgleib/index.html)).
  Analog/multi-zone bumpers can do *compression feedback* (hold a near-constant
  bumper depression); a *binary* bumper (the sim's) caps you at on/off.
- *LiDAR distance following (uses the LiDAR you already have).* Get the wall
  distance *and* angle from two laser rays, then hold a setpoint distance with
  P/PID — smooth, no bumping. Canonical "two-ray" method:
  [MIT RACECAR / F1TENTH lab](https://mit-racecar.github.io/icra2019-workshop/lab-wall-follow-sim),
  [ssscassio](https://github.com/ssscassio/ros-wall-follower-2-wheeled-robot)
  (wander → find wall → follow, `angular = p·e + d·Δe`),
  [IvayloAsenov PID](https://github.com/IvayloAsenov/Wall-Follower-Robot-ROS),
  [JayshKhan / TurtleBot3](https://github.com/JayshKhan/TurtleBot3-Wall-Following).
- *Side-IR intensity following (dedicated wall sensor).* The *map-then-reactive*
  approach detailed below — illuminate the wall with a side IR emitter and hold
  constant reflected intensity. Most vacuum-like, but reflection depends on wall
  colour, so the map+confirm step keeps it honest.

Boundary following is also the core of the *Bug family* (Bug1/Bug2/TangentBug)
for reactive obstacle circumnavigation, and it pairs with interior coverage in
[clean-and-map](../clean-and-map): *perimeter edges first, then boustrophedon fill.*

# Request for Contribution - Instructions

- *wall following* — a *map-then-reactive* approach works well:
  - *(1) candidate walls:* from the map, find where walls are and plan an inward
    *offset contour* to follow (LiDAR-level, deliberative)
  - *(2) drive up to a wall* and *(3) confirm* the robot is actually beside it
    using *side IR wall sensors* (below)
  - *follow:* turn on a *side IR "wall illumination" emitter* and sense the
    wall's reflection on the *side IR receiver*; drive forward holding a constant
    reflected intensity (wall on the left: reflection *weaker* → steer slightly
    *toward* the wall; *stronger* → steer *away*). Add ROS2 enable/disable calls
    for the emitters.
  - integrate with [clean-and-map](../clean-and-map) coverage so edges *and* interior are both covered, without re-cleaning everything
  - post in [Project Discussions](https://github.com/makerspet/oomwoo/discussions?discussions_q=) to let everyone know you're working on it, and post your progress

- *carpet-edge following*
  - detect carpet boundaries and follow the edge to clean along them
- *surface recognition (carpet vs hardwood)*
  - model a plausible sensor in sim (wheel current / IMU vibration / a dedicated downward sensor) and *publish the surface type*
- *mop lift / lower*
  - actuate the mop *up on carpet, down on hardwood*; model the actuator in Gazebo; *never wet a carpet*
  - coordinate with [cleaning-jobs](../cleaning-jobs) for mop-related job constraints
- test it well
  - build worlds with *mixed carpet + hardwood* regions and walls
  - verify edge coverage, correct surface classification, and correct mop state at every transition
- regression tests (headless, CI-friendly)
  - surface-classification accuracy
  - edge-coverage percentage (walls / carpet edges actually cleaned)
  - *zero carpet-wetting events* (mop never down on carpet)
- submit a PR (pull request) to `contributions/floor-care/<your-github-username>/`
  - link to ROS2 package(s) and any sim sensor/actuator + world additions
  - instructions, documentation - how to install, run, configure, troubleshoot, test results
  - videos of wall/edge following and mop lift/lower at surface transitions
  - announce your submission in [Project Discussions](https://github.com/makerspet/oomwoo/discussions?discussions_q=)
- iterate with review
- TBD, expect the RFC to evolve

## Acceptance criteria

Objective, measurable. Examples:
- *Wall / carpet-edge following* cleans tight along edges and integrates with coverage (high edge-coverage %)
- *Surface recognition* classifies carpet vs hardwood accurately
- *Mop lift/lower* tracks surface type correctly with *zero carpet-wetting events*
- *Regression tests* pass (classification accuracy, edge coverage, no carpet-wetting), runnable headless in CI
- Works in at least one *mixed carpet + hardwood* world
- Documented and reliably reproducible by someone else
- TBD, expect criteria to evolve

The maintainer selects among compliant candidates using these criteria. Multiple
attempts are welcome and useful even if not selected — modules are swappable, and
a non-selected design is still a valid learning exercise and a fallback.
