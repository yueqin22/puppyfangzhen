# I/O + Motor-Driver PCB (hardware / KiCad)

The custom [I/O board](https://github.com/makerspet/oomwoo-io-board) that
connects every OOMWOO motor and sensor to the SBC: an STM32 MCU,
motor drivers, sensor front-ends, and battery charging on one PCB. Proposed
software-interface contract: the MCU runs safety-critical firmware and talks to
the CM4/CM5 CPU over a custom serial / USB link.

> *Draft design basis:* OOMWOO v1 uses a *CM4/CM5-style CPU module* for ROS2, Nav2, SLAM,
> so this board is an *I/O + power carrier* — no soldered application processor on it. There is a
> starting-point Kicad schematic and [SPEC.md](https://github.com/makerspet/oomwoo-io-board/blob/main/docs/SPEC.md).

# Request for Contribution — Instructions

Deliver a *KiCad schematic* derived from the reference PDF, trimmed to the I/O side and
updated for OOMWOO, then *hold for review before PCB layout*.

- *Remove the Rockchip subsystem entirely* — the RK3562 SoC and everything that exists only
  to support it: *LPDDR4 DRAM, eMMC, the SoC PMIC / SoC-specific power rails (VCCIO, PMU / OSC
  / PLL), the DDR PHY, the USB / PCIe PHY, and the SoC's MIPI camera interface*. Heavy compute
  and the camera interfaces now come from the *CM4/CM5 module* (whose socket this board adds) —
  the board routes MIPI CSI camera connectors off that socket (see [SPEC](https://github.com/makerspet/oomwoo-io-board/blob/main/docs/SPEC.md)),
  not off a removed SoC.
- *Remove the WiFi / BT module* (AP6256) — WiFi/BT comes from the compute module, or is added
  on the carrier (M.2 / USB) for modules without onboard WiFi (see SPEC).
- *Add a CM4/CM5 socket + support* (adapt the official Raspberry Pi CM4/CM5 IO-board designs)
  so the board is a *carrier* for the compute module; see the [SPEC](https://github.com/makerspet/oomwoo-io-board/blob/main/docs/SPEC.md).
- *Keep and convert to KiCad the I/O side:*
  - *STM32G473VCT6* MCU + support (clock, decoupling, debug / boot, the custom-serial link to the CPU)
  - *motor drivers* — drive wheels (×2), main brush, side brush, water pump, mop lift / spin
    (if fitted); put the *suction fan on an external ESC* (one PWM line) to save MCU pins
  - *sensor front-ends* — cliff / anti-fall IR, docking IR + bumper, side-proximity IR, bumper
    switches, IMU, LiDAR interface, multizone ToF, ultrasonic carpet sensor
  - *battery charging + protection / BMS*, and the board power rails that feed the STM32 /
    sensors / motors (keep these; remove only the SoC-specific rails)
  - speaker + amp, mic, buttons, LEDs
- *Move the battery from 3S to 4S* — OOMWOO targets *~14.8 V* (see [BOM.md](../../BOM.md)). The
  reference appears to be 3S; update the pack, the charge-IC configuration, the protection, and
  any cell-count-dependent dividers / thresholds to *4S*.
- *Reconcile the drive-wheel connectors* with the sourced wheel module and the current
  OOMWOO I/O board KiCad reference before layout; document the final board-side connector,
  harness, motor-power path, encoder pins, and wheel-drop handling.
- assume battery Xiaomi/Roborock/Dreame BRR-2P4S-5200
- *Convert the kept design to KiCad* (from Altium); keep a clean, readable, hierarchical schematic.
- *Hold here for review.* Deliver the trimmed, 4S, KiCad *schematic* and stop — the maintainer
  reviews before anyone starts PCB layout / manufacturing.
- *Submit* a PR to `contributions/io-pcb/<your-github-username>/` with the KiCad project, a short
  sub-BoM, and notes; announce it in [Project Discussions](https://github.com/makerspet/oomwoo/discussions?discussions_q=).
- iterate with review
- TBD, expect the RFC to evolve

## Acceptance criteria (schematic-hold milestone)

- The *entire Rockchip subsystem* (SoC, DRAM, eMMC, PMIC / VCCIO / PMU / PLL, DDR + USB/PCIe
  PHY, MIPI camera) and the *WiFi / BT module* are removed.
- The *kept blocks* (STM32G473, motor drivers, sensor front-ends, battery charging, audio,
  buttons / LEDs, the CM4/CM5 socket + support, and the custom-serial CPU link) are present,
  correct, and complete in *KiCad*.
- Battery as specified
- Drive-wheel connectors are reconciled with the current KiCad reference and part-specs,
  including motor-power path, encoder pins, and wheel-drop handling.
- Delivered as a buildable *KiCad project*; *ERC clean*; a sub-BoM and short design notes included.
- Stops at the reviewed *schematic* — no PCB layout yet.
- Documented and reproducible.
- TBD, expect criteria to evolve.

The maintainer intends to *accelerate* this module and may commission a contributor to do it;
community submissions are still welcome and reviewed the same way. The maintainer selects among
compliant candidates using these criteria — multiple attempts are welcome and useful even if
not selected.

## Appendix A. MCU GPIO budget

The GPIO budget is maintained in the board
[SPEC.md](https://github.com/makerspet/oomwoo-io-board/blob/main/docs/SPEC.md)
(authoritative, and it carries the open TODOs — e.g. the GPIO 36/46 bumper-label question).
It is **not duplicated here**, to avoid the two copies drifting apart.
