# ROS2 Mapping for the I/O Board Bridge

Status: draft mapping for a future `oomwoo_mcu_bridge` node.

## Bridge role

The bridge translates between public ROS2 interfaces and the CPU/MCU serial
contract. It should be thin: ROS2 owns high-level behavior, the MCU owns hard
safety and motor IO.

## Published ROS2 outputs

| Topic | Type | Source frame | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `/odom` | `nav_msgs/msg/Odometry` | `FAST_TELEMETRY` | Optional if bridge computes wheel odometry; otherwise publish wheel data only. |

| `/battery_state` | `sensor_msgs/msg/BatteryState` | `POWER_TELEMETRY` | Voltage, current, charge state, dock/charging flags. |

| `/oomwoo/io/cliff` | `std_msgs/msg/UInt8` initially | `FAST_TELEMETRY`, `SAFETY_EVENT` | Bitfield for cliff sensors. |
| `/oomwoo/io/wheel_drop` | `std_msgs/msg/UInt8` initially | `FAST_TELEMETRY`, `SAFETY_EVENT` | Bitfield for wheel-drop sensors. |

| `/diagnostics` | `diagnostic_msgs/msg/DiagnosticArray` | All telemetry | Standard integration with ROS tooling. |
| `/oomwoo/status` | `std_msgs/msg/String` initially | Bridge policy + safety frames | JSON status compatible with current recovery prototype. |

## QoS and rates

| Interface | QoS/rate |
|---|---|
| `/cmd_vel` input | Reliable or best-effort with small queue; stale values must not be replayed. |
| `DRIVE_SETPOINT` serial output | 20-50 Hz while active, short duration field. |
| `FAST_TELEMETRY` serial input | 50-100 Hz target. |
| Battery/power topics | 1-5 Hz. |
| Diagnostics | 1 Hz plus event bursts. |
| Safety events | Reliable where possible, repeated while latched. |

## Lifecycle behavior

The bridge should be a lifecycle node or equivalent state machine.

| State | Behavior |
|---|---|
| `unconfigured` | No serial connection, no actuator commands. |
| `inactive` | Serial may be open, but no heartbeat and no motion outputs. |
| `active` | Heartbeat running, setpoints accepted, telemetry published. |
| `error` | Heartbeat stopped, setpoints zeroed, diagnostics explain cause. |

On deactivate, shutdown, or crash, the heartbeat stops. The MCU then stops
motion independently.

## Arbitration

Only one ROS2 component should write `/cmd_vel` at a time. The bridge should not
solve high-level arbitration; it should enforce low-level safety:

- clamp max linear/angular velocity
- clamp setpoint duration
- send zero setpoints on deactivate
- stop forwarding motion while e-stop, cliff, wheel-drop, or CPU timeout is
  latched

Docking has a special low-speed phase after Nav2 reaches a known predock pose.
During that phase, the dock controller may publish `/oomwoo/dock/final_cmd_vel`;
the bridge should apply tighter velocity clamps and shorter setpoint durations
than normal navigation, while the MCU keeps the same hard-stop authority.

## Message evolution

Start with standard ROS2 messages for the first bridge:

- `geometry_msgs/msg/Twist`
- `sensor_msgs/msg/BatteryState`
- `sensor_msgs/msg/JointState`
- `diagnostic_msgs/msg/DiagnosticArray`
- small `std_msgs` bitfields where custom messages are not yet worth freezing

Once the real hardware signals stabilize, promote the bitfields into an
`oomwoo_msgs` package.
