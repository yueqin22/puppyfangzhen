# Procure Part Specs & Datasheets for Sourced Components

We've already sourced candidate parts (see [BOM.md](../../BOM.md)). To design the I/O
board and firmware, *drive the motors and fans*, and build accurate mounts, we need each
part's detailed *electrical + mechanical specs* — pinouts, voltages, currents, encoder
PPR, torque, waveforms, etc. Vendors rarely publish these for vacuum sub-assemblies, so
contributors will *find datasheets, ask vendors, or safely reverse-engineer* them.

This is the *electrical/mechanical data* companion to
[source-3d-models](../source-3d-models) (which covers the *geometry*). No robotics
background needed — a multimeter, patience, and (for reverse-engineering) an oscilloscope go far.

Please check [BOM.md](../../BOM.md) and the [sourcing follow-along blog post](https://makerspet.com/blog/how-to-source-bom-for-oomwoo-open-source-vacuum-robot/)
for datasheets/specs already found.

## What we need, per part

### Drive wheel assembly (Roborock-family — see BOM)
- motor model; motor/assembly *datasheet* (if any)
- *encoder type + PPR* (pulses per revolution)
- *gearbox ratio*; *wheel diameter*
- rated + max motor *voltage*, *current* (no-load & stall), *torque*
- max / rated wheel *speed*
- *cable length(s)*; *connector models* (both ends); *full connector + motor pinouts*
- *wheel-drop sensor* model + pinout (these modules include one)
- signal *waveforms* (encoder channels, motor drive)
- assembly *weight*

### Suction fan / blower (several options sourced — see BOM)
- fan/motor model; *datasheet*
- rated *voltage, current, RPM*; *airflow* + *static pressure (Pa)*
- *how to drive it* — BLDC driver + control interface (PWM / tach / hall / 3-phase),
  soft-start / protection behaviour
- *connector model(s) + pinout*; cable length
- signal *waveforms*
- *weight*

### Caster / universal wheel assembly (Roomba-family — see BOM)
- model, dimensions, mounting, any embedded sensor, weight, datasheet

## Already found vs still missing 

*Found*
- *Fan datasheet (some options):* https://file.elecfans.com/web1/M00/CC/89/o4YBAF-ZOBKAQBvyADDMAglsvTw020.pdf
- *Nidec BLDC motors* (candidate fan motors — *bare motors, not the full suction assemblies*):
  [NCJ-20N Type-3](https://www.nidec.com/en/product/search/category/B101/M102/S100/NCJ-20N-Type-3/),
  [NCJ-20N Type-4](https://www.nidec.com/en/product/search/category/B101/M102/S100/NCJ-20N-Type-4/)
- *Driving the fans:* [ripinteer/fan_protector](https://github.com/ripinteer/fan_protector)
  — reference for driving / protecting the BLDC blower (from earlier project research)

*Still missing (help wanted)*
- Connector *pinouts* + cable lengths for wheels, fans, caster
- *Encoder type + PPR*, gearbox ratios, torque/current under load
- *Wheel-drop sensor* model + pinout
- Signal *waveforms* (encoder, motor/fan drive)
- Suction-*assembly*-level datasheets (we have some bare motors, not the assemblies)
- Weights; caster specs

## Reverse-engineering — only if specs can't be found, and SAFELY

If a spec isn't published, reverse-engineer it by opening an existing vacuum and probing.
*Safety first:*
- Don't do it unless you're qualified, experienced.
- Opening a vacuum usually *voids the warranty* and *can damage it* — accept that risk knowingly.
- *Secure / prop up the vacuum* so it can't scoot off the table or bench when the wheels or
  fan spin during testing (clamp it, or raise the wheels off the surface).
- Respect the *Li-ion battery* — don't short, pierce, or stress the pack; disconnect where sensible.
- Mind *pinch points and spinning parts* — keep fingers/hair clear of the impeller and brushes.
- Any *mains-connected* testing (e.g. a dock) — extra caution; isolate.
- Use a *multimeter + oscilloscope* to capture voltages, currents, and waveforms; trace and
  *label connector pinouts*; photograph everything.

*Legal:*
- By performing any work for this project including reverse engineering you agree to
  - wave liability, indemnify this project, the legal entity behind it (Remake AI Statutory Trust) and and its founder
  - contribute your work and results thereof, if any, as open-source, to be published under Apache 2.0 license

## Submit

A PR to `contributions/part-specs/<your-github-username>/<part>/`:
- a spec sheet (markdown table) with everything you found
- any datasheets (PDF) and source links
- photos of connectors + labelled pinouts
- waveform captures where reverse-engineered
- provenance — which vendor / model / revision the data is from
- announce it in [Project Discussions](https://github.com/makerspet/oomwoo/discussions?discussions_q=)

## Acceptance criteria

- Spec sheet for a part (or a clearly-scoped subset)
- Datasheets / links where found
  - pinouts + waveforms where reverse-engineered when appropriate
- Provenance stated (part / vendor / revision)
- Verifiable by someone else with the same part
- TBD, expect criteria to evolve

The maintainer selects among compliant candidates using these criteria. Multiple attempts
are welcome and useful even if not selected — a non-selected spec sheet is still a valid
reference and a fallback.
