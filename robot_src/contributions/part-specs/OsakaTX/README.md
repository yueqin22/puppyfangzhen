## 1. Drive Wheel Assembly (Roborock S-family)

### Part Identification

The Roborock S4/S5/S5-Max/S6/S7-family drive wheel module is a complete unit:
gearmotor + incremental encoder + rubber tire + suspension + wheel-drop switch.
See BOM.md for the full Aliexpress search links.

### Motor Specs (Nidec 20N704RC70 — "Motor for Wheel")

Sourced from the [Nidec Robot Cleaner Motor catalog PDF](https://file.elecfans.com/web1/M00/CC/89/o4YBAF-ZOBKAQBvyADDMAglsvTw020.pdf):

| Parameter | Value |
|---|---|
| **Rated voltage** | 14.4 V |
| **No-load speed** | 16,800 rpm |
| **No-load current** | 0.4 A |
| **Rated speed** | 13,200 rpm |
| **Rated current** | 1.4 A |
| **Maximum power** | 13.8 W |
| **Noise (SPL)** | 45 dB(A) |
| **Status** | ⚠️ "In development" per Nidec catalog — model may have changed in production |

**Note:** The actual motor used in production Roborock wheels may differ from the
catalog entry above. The wheel module includes a **gearbox** (see estimated ratio below)
that reduces this to the final wheel RPM. The encoder is mounted after the gearbox.

### Wheel Dimensions (from PR #10 — alvarosamudio's URDF, merged)

| Dimension | Value |
|---|---|
| **Wheel diameter** | 0.065 m (65 mm) |
| **Robot body diameter** | 0.33 m (330 mm) |

### Encoder

- **Type:** **Single-channel Hall-effect sensor** (pulse output) — confirmed via physical inspection by Scowt PR #13 (merged). The wheel-side 7-pin JST connector has exactly **one** encoder signal wire (blue), plus 5V (orange) and GND (brown). This is NOT a quadrature A/B encoder.
- **GD32 decoding:** The GD32F103VCT6 hardware timer performs **4× edge counting** on the single pulse train (rising + falling edges × 2 timer channels), producing effective 4× resolution.
- **Effective ticks/rev (wheel shaft):** **~911 ticks/rev** — derived from the calibrated `ticks_per_meter = 4464.0` (VacuumTiger firmware, confirmed in `encoder_sim.rs` unit test) and wheel circumference = π × 0.065 m ≈ 0.2042 m. Calculation: 4464 ticks/m × 0.2042 m/rev ≈ 911 ticks/rev.
- **PPR:** **~228 PPR** (raw encoder pulses per wheel revolution) — 911 / 4 = ~228. Typical multi-pole magnetic ring encoders range from 8-32 poles, making a multi-pole ring a plausible mechanism but this pole count is speculative without physical inspection.
- **Directional ambiguity:** The single-channel encoder alone cannot determine rotation direction. Direction is resolved by the **IMU gyro** in the navigation pipeline (VacuumTiger dhruva-slam).
- **Data format:** u16 LE wrapping counter at offsets 0x10 (left wheel) / 0x18 (right wheel) in the 96-byte GD32 status packet, streamed at 110 Hz. Confirmed from codetiger/VacuumTiger `sangam-io/src/devices/crl200s/gd32/reader.rs` and `SENSORSTATUS.md`.
- **Calibrated odometry:** `ticks_per_meter = 4464.0`, `wheel_base = 0.233 m` — empirically calibrated on real hardware and confirmed in multiple VacuumTiger source files: `sangam-io/src/devices/mock/config.rs`, `dhruva-nav/dhruva.toml`, `dhruva-slam/src/sensors/odometry/wheel_odometry.rs`, and `dhruva-nav/src/odometry.rs`.

### Gearbox Ratio

- **Estimated ratio:** **~190:1** — derived from `VELOCITY_TO_DEVICE_UNITS = 523.0` (empirically calibrated in VacuumTiger `commands.rs`) and the verified max linear speed of 0.3 m/s. At 16,800 rpm no-load motor speed with 0.065 m wheels, a ~190:1 reduction produces a max wheel speed consistent with 0.3 m/s. Confirmed consistent with the calibrated ticks/m and 911 ticks/rev at the wheel shaft.
- **Physical verification:** ❌ **Not yet confirmed via tooth counting** — requires disassembly.

### Connectors

#### Wheel Module Connector (7-pin JST, cable side)

Confirmed by Scowt PR #13 physical inspection (merged):

| Pin | Wire Color | Function |
|-----|-----------|----------|
| 1 | Grey | Limit switch (wheel-drop, NC) |
| 2 | Grey | Limit switch (wheel-drop, common) |
| 3 | Orange | Encoder VCC (+5V) |
| 4 | Blue | Encoder signal (single-channel pulse) |
| 5 | Brown | Encoder GND |
| 6 | Black | Motor power (-) |
| 7 | Red | Motor power (+) |

**Cable length:** ~250 mm (per Scowt observation).

#### Mainboard Connectors (J25/J26 — 16-pin SHD 1.0mm)

Motor power is on **separate connectors** (J24 left / J27 right, 2-pin PH 2.0mm) — NOT carried by J25/J26.

**J25 (bottom, left wheel):** Left wheel encoder (3 wires) + Dustbox power + Left cliff sensor + Left bumper
**J26 (top, right wheel):** Right wheel encoder (3 wires) + Sweeper motor power + Right cliff sensor + Right bumper

Per codetiger/VacuumRobot reverse-engineering. **Full per-pin map** requires PCB continuity tracing (multimeter). The signal groups above are established; the exact pin-to-signal assignment within each group is hypothesis.

### Motor Driver IC

- **IC:** **TMI8870** (TOLL Microelectronic) — top mark "T8870", ESOP8 package
- **Specs:** Single H-bridge, 3.6A peak, 6.8-45V, PWM with integrated current regulation
- **Pin-compatible:** With TI DRV8870
- **Confirmed via:** TMI8870 datasheet (taoic.oss-cn-hangzhou.aliyuncs.com) matching the "8870" marking on U25 on the motherboard (photographed in codetiger/VacuumRobot Component_Diagram.md)
- **Dual ICs:** Since TMI8870 is a single-channel H-bridge and the robot has two wheels, a second matching IC should exist on the motherboard (near J27 for the right wheel)

### Wheel Module Weight

- **Pair:** ~463g (0.463 kg shipped pair — AliExpress listing for original Roborock S6 wheel module)
- **Single:** ~230g (estimated from pair weight)

### What We Still Need

| Item | Status |
|---|---|
| Exact gearbox ratio via tooth counting | ❌ Needs disassembly |
| Full J25/J26 per-pin map | ❌ Needs PCB continuity tracing |
| Wheel-drop sensor exact model | ❌ Needs physical inspection |
| Cable length (exact) | ❌ Needs physical measurement |
| Motor driver IC location for right wheel | ❌ Needs PCB inspection |

## 7. Caster Wheel

**⚠️ BOM specifies a Roomba-style caster** (iRobot part #4624869, $2.50-$5 push-in ball-type). The Roborock S-family caster (50mm wheel-type, OEM #9.01.1272/1273) is a different part — verify which is selected before designing the mount.

> **Note on Roborock caster SKUs:** replacement listings cite more than one OEM number for the S-family caster — `9.01.1272/1273` (~50mm wheel, ~45mm base) above, and `HA00021` (~46 × 52mm) in [`io-board-wheel-connector-and-caster.md`](io-board-wheel-connector-and-caster.md). These appear to be the same donor part under different reseller SKUs; the BOM's primary remains the Roomba-style iRobot 4624869. Confirm the exact SKU and dimensions against the selected part before designing the mount.
