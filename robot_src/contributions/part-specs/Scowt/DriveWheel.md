## Drive Wheel pinout and cable length: ##
  - Pinout:
    - pin 1: Limit switch, grey
    - pin 2: Limit switch, grey
    - pin 3: Encoder 5v, orange
    - pin 4: Encoder Signal, blue
    - pin 5: Encoder Ground, brown
    - pin 6: Motor power, black
    - pin 7: Motor power, red
    - Note: Some uncertainty around the encoder wires; I agreed with https://electronics.stackexchange.com/questions/549640/how-to-find-pinout-of-dc-geared-motor-with-encoder but do not have a pcb to hand to confirm. The comments there suggest the encoder is hall effect, but am not certain this is true.
  - Cable length:
    - 250mm ( Estimate Only - based on examining photos, please confirm with physical article )
  - Connector: 
    - JST, might be XH but not certain.
