# Compute Benchmark Plan by xbattlax

This contribution turns the compute discussion in issue #18 into a concrete
benchmark scaffold for OOMWOO.

The immediate goal is to keep OOMWOO's onboard ROS2, Nav2, and SLAM runtime
measurable as hardware and launch files evolve. As of July 18, 2026, the
maintainer reports that the Pi 4 2 GB Ubuntu 24.04 server runtime can run SLAM
from replayed rosbags with about 1.1 GB physical memory free; the reported
slam_toolbox measurement was 105 MB RSS / 65 MB PSS using
[`jayadevrana/oomwoo-m1-ros2`](https://github.com/jayadevrana/oomwoo-m1-ros2)
`deploy/pi_runtime/measure_pi_baseline.sh`.

That makes Pi 4 2 GB a provisional baseline to reproduce and track, not merely a
stretch target. The remaining caveat is live hardware: MCU serial, real sensors,
dock/IR homing, and camera workloads still need measured headroom.

The first optimization path should be ROS2 composable nodes where supported,
plus launch/process layout. Rust with rclrs is kept as a serious optional spike
for late August / September 2026, gated by measurements and dev-image
reproducibility.

## Scope

Included:

- a Linux `/proc`-based process sampler for RSS/PSS/CPU
- a run matrix template for repeatable benchmark scenarios
- a compute BOM template for board/module, carrier, power, cooling, storage,
  MCU add-ons, regional pricing, and stock status
- a short architecture decision record for the current memory-reduction plan

Not included yet:

- a Rust/rclrs node implementation
- a C++/rclcpp equivalent node
- independently repeated physical Pi 4 / CM4 / CM5 result submissions
- automated launch files for full SLAM/Nav2 runs

## Hardware Profiles To Record

| Profile | Purpose | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Dev machine | Reference only | Useful for repeatability, not a robot target. |
| Pi 4 2 GB | Provisional minimum target | Maintainer reported SLAM with about 1.1 GB free on Ubuntu 24.04 server; reproduce before treating it as final. |
| Pi 4 4 GB | Headroom target | Useful once live MCU, dock/IR, and camera workloads are added. |
| CM4 4 GB | Consumer carrier-board target | Low profile and product-friendly. |
| CM5 4 GB+ | Higher headroom target | Useful if camera/NPU alternatives are evaluated. |
| 2 GB class SBC/module | Low-cost target | Needs repeated measurements across full live workload. |
| ESP32 educational profile | Offboard ROS2/SLAM learning setup | Not a consumer autonomous vacuum profile. |

## Measurement Scenarios

Start with these scenarios:

1. ROS2 graph idle after launch.
2. SLAM running with 5 Hz LiDAR input and no scan dropping.
3. Nav2 navigating on a known map.
4. Recovery/safety node idle.
5. Recovery/safety event burst.
6. Same workload after composable-node or process-layout changes.
7. Dock/IR homing simulation workload.
8. Optional front obstacle camera workload.
9. Later: same selected custom node in Python, C++/rclcpp, and Rust/rclrs.

## Using The Sampler

Run this inside the Linux ROS2 environment while the target workload is already
running:

```bash
bash contributions/compute-benchmark/xbattlax/scripts/measure_ros_processes.sh \
  --pattern 'ros2|component_container|python3|slam_toolbox|nav2' \
  --duration 60 \
  --interval 2 \
  --label slam_5hz_baseline \
  --output /tmp/oomwoo-slam-5hz-baseline.csv
```

The script writes CSV with:

- timestamp
- sample index
- label
- PID
- process name
- CPU percent
- RSS KiB
- PSS KiB when `/proc/<pid>/smaps_rollup` is available
- command line

PSS is usually more useful than RSS for ROS2 systems because shared libraries and
middleware pages can make RSS look worse than the actual proportional memory
pressure.

## Templates

- `templates/run_matrix.csv`: planned benchmark runs and environment details.
- `templates/compute_bom.csv`: compute BOM and regional stock/price snapshot.

Copy the templates into a results folder for real benchmark submissions. Do not
edit old result rows after a run; add a new row for a new measurement.

## Expected Decision Output

Each benchmark batch should end with a short note:

- current measured minimum RAM class
- biggest memory users
- whether composable nodes helped
- whether any Python node is worth porting to C++ or Rust
- whether Rust/rclrs setup is reproducible enough to keep testing
- what hardware profile the result supports
- remaining headroom after live MCU serial, dock/IR homing, and optional camera
  workloads are included
