# Bill of Materials (work in progress)

First working BoM is targeted for *mid-July '26*

A final, fully-costed BoM is targeted for *end of August '26*

Blog post - how I'm making this BOM [How-to: Source BOM for OOMWOO Open-Source Vacuum Robot](https://makerspet.com/blog/how-to-source-bom-for-oomwoo-open-source-vacuum-robot/)

Rationale in [docs/design-document.md](docs/design-document.md).

---

## Budget target

~$200 in sourced parts + a Raspberry Pi 5 (4 GB), aiming at the capability of a
mid-range ($500–600) commercial vacuum with mopping, possibly premium obstacle detection (ToF +
color camera + an NPU accelerator).

## Robot BoM (work in progress)

Retail / low-qty prices, INCLUDES shipping, excludes tax. Read [how I calculate BoM costs](#how-i-calculate-costs).

Three dock tiers share one robot base, released in order:

| Tier | Adds | Rough extra parts |
|---|---|---|
| Basic charge (first release) | charging only | printed housing + contacts/magnets + wall adapter + IR beacon |
| Auto-empty | dust auto-emptying | dock fan + bin/bag + sealed port |
| Auto-empty + wash + dry | mop wash + hot-air dry | clean + dirty tanks, 2 pumps, heater + fan, own ESP32 + WiFi controller |

## Sourcing strategy

- Print geometry, source mechanisms and wear items. See the print-vs-source table in
  [docs/design-document.md](docs/design-document.md#2-print-vs-source-strategy).
- Spec wear parts (brushes, filters, wheel modules) in *common, abundant sizes* so
  builders can buy cheap universal replacements anywhere.
- Per-module sourcing details will land in the relevant
  [contributions/](contributions) RFCs as they mature.

## How I calculate BoM costs

Prices for vacuum cleaner aftermarket parts have a wide spread (3x max/min as a ballpark).
You can buy same part for, say, $15 or $30 or even $45.

Therefore, if you search [AliExpress](https://www.aliexpress.us/w/wholesale-roborock-s5-lidar.html)/eBay/Amazon
for, say, "Roborock S5 LiDAR", you will likely see offers around $30.

There will probably several pages worth of those offers. And if you dig through those pages, you will probably start
finding parts for $25.

If you are shopping on AliExpress, open a part listing and check for free coupon offers like "$2.00 off on $18.00".
That brings your $25 price down to $23. Also, check the fine print in red font saying something like "$21.43 each, ≥ 3 pieces".

That's not the end of it. The next AliExpress trick is to wait for seasonal sales and promotions. Those happen relatively often.
Sales and promotions can bring prices down even futher.

How can you get to the rock-bottom $15 price? Aftermarket parts prices depend on your search keywords.
Try searching for multiple keyword variations: "Roborock S5 LDS", "Roborock S5 LiDAR", "original laser distance lds",
"LDS02RR", "LDS02RR LiDAR", "Roborock LDS02RR", "LDS laser sensor for xiaomi Roborock" and so on. Be creative and persistent.
Try searching Google "site:aliexpress.com lds02rr" and other variations. Be creative and persistent.

Combining all these methods is how you can get the rock bottom $15 price.

I record two prices for each part in the BoM table, for example "$15-$25".
The first ($15) price is the rock bottom one that often requires a minimum purchase of 3 pieces - what I'd (or anyone) be paying putting together an OOMWOO all-parts-included convenience kit.
The second ($25) price is what you can realistically get when purchasing 1 piece, *applying coupons* and doing *a few minutes of search*.

Why record the first price if requires a 3 pcs minimum? This is because I intend to assemble a convenient parts kit - and make it available to everyone.
